# Game Finished - Congratulations Feature

## Overview
When the game finishes (a team solves the last puzzle), all players see a congratulations animation followed by the final leaderboard.

## Components Created

### 1. CongratulationsAnimation.js
**Location**: `src/components/CongratulationsAnimation.js`

**Features**:
- 🎊 Animated confetti falling from top
- 🏆 Spinning trophy/coin icon with glow effect
- 🎉 Dynamic message based on whether current player's team won
- ⏱️ Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- 🏴‍☠️ Pirate-themed with gold and treasure aesthetics

**Props**:
- `winningTeamName` (string) - Name of the winning team
- `isWinner` (boolean) - Whether the current player's team won
- `onComplete` (function) - Callback when animation finishes

**Messages**:
- For winners: "🎉 Victory! 🎉" + "Your team has won!"
- For others: "🏆 Game Over! 🏆" + "Victory goes to [Team Name]"

### 2. FinishedGamePage.js
**Location**: `src/FinishedGamePage/FinishedGamePage.js`

**Logic**:
1. Loads current player's team from localStorage
2. Loads leaderboard to find winning team (rank 1)
3. Determines if current player's team is the winner
4. Shows CongratulationsAnimation for 5 seconds
5. Transitions to final LeaderboardMain page

## CSS Animations Added

**Location**: `src/index.css`

### New Animations:
```css
@keyframes confetti - Falling confetti from top to bottom with rotation
@keyframes spin-slow - Slow 360° rotation over 3 seconds
```

### Classes:
- `.animate-confetti` - Falling confetti animation
- `.animate-spin-slow` - Slow spinning trophy effect

## App.js Integration

**Updated**: `case GAME_STATES.FINISHED:`
- Now renders `<FinishedGamePage />` instead of directly showing leaderboard
- This ensures congratulations animation plays first

## User Flow

1. **Last puzzle solved** → Backend sets game state to FINISHED
2. **Game state WebSocket** → All clients receive FINISHED state
3. **App.js re-renders** → Detects FINISHED state
4. **FinishedGamePage mounts**:
   - Determines winning team from leaderboard
   - Shows CongratulationsAnimation
5. **After 5 seconds**:
   - Animation completes
   - Shows final LeaderboardMain

## Features

### For Winning Team:
- ✅ "🎉 Victory! 🎉" headline
- ✅ "Your team has won!" message
- ✅ Confetti animation
- ✅ Team name displayed prominently

### For Other Teams:
- ✅ "🏆 Game Over! 🏆" headline
- ✅ "Victory goes to [Winner]" message
- ✅ Confetti animation
- ✅ Winning team name displayed

### Visual Elements:
- 🎯 50 animated confetti pieces with random colors (gold, silver, bronze)
- 🏆 Spinning trophy icon with glow effect
- 🏴‍☠️ Pirate profile image
- 🌟 Smooth fade-in and scale-in animations
- ⏱️ Progress message: "Showing final leaderboard in a moment..."

## Testing

To test this feature:
1. Start a game with multiple teams
2. Solve puzzles until the last one
3. When the last puzzle is solved:
   - All players should see the congratulations animation
   - Winning team sees "Victory!"
   - Other teams see "Game Over!" with winner name
4. After 5 seconds, leaderboard appears for all players

## Customization

### Change Animation Duration:
In `CongratulationsAnimation.js`, modify:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  if (onComplete) onComplete();
}, 5000); // Change 5000 to desired milliseconds
```

### Change Confetti Count:
In `CongratulationsAnimation.js`, modify:
```javascript
{[...Array(50)].map((_, i) => ( // Change 50 to desired count
```
